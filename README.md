# Azure-Voice-to-Text Documentation

## Introduction
Azure-Voice-to-Text is a project developed during a hackathon, utilizing Azure Cognitive Services. The project incorporates text-to-speech and text classification functionalities.

## Poharogapp
Poharogapp is a web application designed for medical consultations in hospitals, facilitating both in-person and virtual visits. This application enables recording and transcribing consultations into text format using Azure's text-to-speech service. The transcribed text is then passed through our API, which leverages an AI model trained with Azure's text classification capabilities.

## Technology Stack
The application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, which provides a lightweight and flexible foundation for web development.

## Key Features
1. Medical Consultation Recording: Poharogapp allows users to record medical consultations, capturing the audio content for future reference.
2. Transcription: Azure's text-to-speech service is utilized to convert the recorded audio into text, providing a textual representation of the consultation.
3. Text Classification: The transcribed text is processed using our API, which leverages an AI model trained with Azure's text classification capabilities. This enables categorization and analysis of the consultation content.

## Getting Started
To run the Azure-Voice-to-Text project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from [GitHub link].
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Configure the Azure Cognitive Services credentials in the application to enable text-to-speech and text classification functionalities.
4. Launch the Flask application by executing python app.py in the project directory.
5. Access the Poharogapp web interface through your browser to begin using the application.

## Conclusion
Azure-Voice-to-Text, with its integration of Azure's text-to-speech and text classification services, provides a powerful solution for medical consultations. Poharogapp's ability to record, transcribe, and analyze consultations enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare professionals.
