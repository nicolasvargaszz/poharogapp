Azure-Voice-to-Text Documentation
Introduction
Welcome to the Azure-Voice-to-Text project! Developed during a hackathon, this innovative project utilizes Azure Cognitive Services to integrate text-to-speech and text classification functionalities. Our solution aims to enhance medical consultations by recording, transcribing, and analyzing conversations efficiently.

üåü Overview
Poharogapp is a web application designed to streamline medical consultations in hospitals, whether they are in-person or virtual. The application provides a robust platform for recording and transcribing medical consultations, transforming spoken words into actionable text. This transcribed text is then analyzed using Azure's advanced AI capabilities, providing valuable insights and classifications.

üöÄ Technology Stack
The application leverages the following technologies:

Flask: A lightweight Python web framework that serves as the backbone of the web application, offering flexibility and ease of development.
Azure Cognitive Services: Includes text-to-speech for converting audio to text and text classification for analyzing the transcribed content.
Python: The primary programming language used for developing the application logic and integrating Azure services.
üîë Key Features
Medical Consultation Recording:

Allows users to record both in-person and virtual medical consultations.
Ensures high-quality audio capture for accurate transcription.
Transcription:

Utilizes Azure's text-to-speech service to convert recorded audio into text.
Provides a clear and accurate textual representation of the consultation.
Text Classification:

Processes transcribed text through our API, leveraging Azure's AI model.
Categorizes and analyzes consultation content to provide actionable insights.
User Interface:

Intuitive web interface for easy interaction with the application.
Supports user authentication to secure access to sensitive data.
