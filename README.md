‚òÅ‚õÖÔ∏è Azure Voice-to-Text Documentation
üåü Introduction
Azure Voice-to-Text is an innovative project developed during a hackathon, leveraging Azure Cognitive Services. The project integrates text-to-speech and text classification functionalities to provide a comprehensive solution for transcribing and analyzing audio data.

üè• Poharogapp
Poharogapp is a web application designed for medical consultations, both in-person and virtual. This application records and transcribes consultations into text format using Azure's text-to-speech service. The transcribed text is then processed through our API, which utilizes an AI model trained with Azure's text classification capabilities.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
The application is developed using:

Flask: A Python web framework providing a lightweight and flexible foundation for web development.
Azure Cognitive Services: For text-to-speech and text classification functionalities.
‚ú® Key Features
Medical Consultation Recording: Poharogapp allows users to record medical consultations, capturing audio content for future reference.
Transcription: Utilizes Azure's text-to-speech service to convert recorded audio into text, providing a textual representation of the consultation.
Text Classification: The transcribed text is analyzed using our API, which leverages an AI model trained with Azure's text classification services. This enables detailed categorization and analysis of the consultation content.
üöÄ Getting Started
To run the Azure Voice-to-Text project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from [GitHub link].
Install the dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Configure Azure Cognitive Services credentials in the application to enable text-to-speech and text classification functionalities.
Launch the Flask application by executing python app.py in the project directory.
